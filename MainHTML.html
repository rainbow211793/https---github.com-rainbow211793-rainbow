<!--

Hello and welcome to a prototype of a video game built on JS, HTML and CSS. This projected was started when I started to learn JS but I decided to pick it up and transform it into a
new and improved version potentially available for the public. I hope you find my code very clean and also the comments very usefull and clean for all of you. If you would like to
see more of my code please feel free to look through my X(@Rlolcat) or friend on Discord at @rainbow211793 to encourage or ask about how these projects may have been made
